// This file is used to to describe the wiring of the Address Lines that are common to all EEPROMs
//
// There are 3 groups - M_CYCLE, IR (Instruction Register) and FLAG, all of which are required
//
// UPPER_CASE_NAMES are predefined names
// lower_case_names are user defined - in this case they are reserved for defining the flags
//
// The format of this file is:
// [section-name]
// pin-name     address-bit


[M_CYCLE]                           // Machine Cycle Counter
M0          0                               // Up to 8 counter bits can be assigned (M0 -> M7)
M1          1                               // The lowest bit must be called M0
M2          2                               // The bits must be contiguous

[IR]                                // Instruction Register
IR_4        3                               // Any of the 8 Instruction Register bits (IR_0 -> IR_7) can be assigned
IR_5        4                               // There is no requirement the bits be contiguous
IR_6        5
IR_7        6

[FLAG]                              // Flags Register
cf          7                               // flag name are user defined
